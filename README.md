# Hashim here
A Pakistan based cs student.
Currently exploring front-end development and building out projects to sharpen my skills. Focused on writing clean, functional code and experimenting with modern web technologies.
Interested in full-stack development and gradually moving towards a more complete understanding of how things work end-to-end.
Most of the work here is a reflection of ongoing learningâ€”projects may vary in quality but everything contributes to growth.
Always interested in practical solutions, good design, and building useful things.
